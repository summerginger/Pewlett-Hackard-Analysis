# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Challenges
## Overview of the analysis
  This project helps prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.
### The purpose
  The purpose is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify eligible employees to participate in a mentorship program. 
## Results:
  There are four significant points from the two analysis deliverables: 
  
  1—	About 133,776 numbers row affected in the retirement titles file according to their birthdate between '1952-01-01' and '1955-12-31'.
  
  2—	In unique titles file, the duplicate titles were removed, and there are 90,398 roles have been affected.

## Summary

  In conclusion, there are about 90,398 roles will need to be filled as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time.

  And there are only 1,549 retirement-ready and qualified employees to mentor new hiring staff; that is a 1:58 ratio, which seems not enough. However, in my opinion, it also   depends on their role, job responsibilities, and position.  The company could hire new college graduates in the same field of role to fill the needs and provide training to new staff through video learning or an online learning platform. Only then might it not be an issue regarding the small number of eligible senior mentors. And only two managerial positions need to be replaced, the company could promote other suitable, royal staffs to take the role as incentives. Therefore, there are always the way but we should prepare ahead to tackle the challenges.
